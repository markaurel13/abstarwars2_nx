/* abs_extras.c -- the port's own pages for the tiny planets' links: the
 * fallback, used only when abs_ctl.lua could not make the game's own popup
 * (or a URL reached Launcher.openURL), and the list of the videos on the SD
 * card that the game's popups offer.
 *
 * On the episode screen, small planets beside the big ones (the space
 * station, a Mars rover, Apollo, Europa, Facebook, Twitter...) and a few
 * buttons elsewhere called url.prompt(id): "leave the game?", then a web page
 * -- NASA's articles and videos, mostly. There is no browser here, and the
 * pages are long gone, so abs_ctl.lua hands the link's name (NASA_URL...) to
 * this file instead, which shows a page about its topic over the game, and
 * plays its video if the player put one on the SD card:
 *     sd:/switch/abspace_nx/videos/<topic>.mp4     (topic: the list below, e.g.
 *                                                nasa.mp4 for the ISS video)
 * The texts are the port's own. A link that arrives as a URL (the game's
 * Launcher.openURL) is matched by its t= parameter.
 *
 * Controls: left/right choose, A presses, B closes; touch works too. MIT.
